Far enough to avoid bustling downtown Boston, but close enough to see some of the world's finest museums, stadiums and historical sites in minutes. Stay with us! Unlike most Boston apartments, here we are surrounded by trees and church bells, though you can still hear trains coming and going from the nearby train station.  Located in one of Boston's more unique, trendy, up-and-coming neighborhoods, Jamaica Plain offers many off beat, new age businesses and green public spaces.  Free WiFi with desktop computer in your room, for your use alone. We have our own computers so the desktop is all yours!  Also included in your room is an exercise bike,  small closet, desk, chair, and air conditioner! Besides the generous accommodations in your private room, guests have access to the entire apartment except the master bedroom.

More generally, Jamaica Plain is an up-and-coming part of Boston filled with young and progressive people. Whether you want to attend a political rally, a poetry reading, or visit an organic urban farm, JP always delivers! Cooking will be allowed, but if, as expected, you go out to try local restaurants, Jamaica Plain is known to have some of the finest and most unique dining experiences in the Greater Boston area. From traditional American to tapas, JP truly has restaurants covered.","IMPORTANT NOTE: We have a dog!  Clyde is a 3 year old pit bull. He is a very sweet, gentle-natured, strong willed, and energetic family dog. Some people may be afraid of a large notorious breed such as his, and if so, this is probably not the listing you should respond to. Just know that, though Clyde may jump in your lap and lick your face, he has never had a seriously negative interaction with a human or dog. Also of note: most of the pictures are from the listing when we recently purchased the house. Nothing has changed structurally, but the space is now ""lived in"", and some of the furniture has been upgraded. I cannot stress this enough: WE LIVE HERE, WITH A DOG!","On-street parking is free in our neighborhood! We also have one spot ""off street"", at the end of our driveway, which we would be open to allowing guests to use if they are uncomfortable with on-street parking for some reason. There is a bus stop about a tenth of a mile from our front door, and it can take you to the train station (orange line) less than a half mile from us, which can connect you to anywhere in the city and even, if you take the commuter rail, most of southern New England.  For bikers, there are several trails in Jamaica Plain, and Boston is generally one of the most bike friendly cities in America, with bike lanes throughout the city.","Free WiFi with desktop computer in your room, for your use alone.

Besides the generous accommodations in your private room, guests have access to the entire apartment except the master bedroom.

Free coffee and light breakfast such as cereal, toast, and bagels included. Feel free to use the kitchen for cooking of your own light meals, but please do try to be responsible and respectful.  Washer and dryer located in basement are ours alone, not shared with the upstairs neighbor, so feel free to use them at whatever times are needed. Last but certainly not least, there is a very good chance that you will end up with a loving dog trying to jump into your arms, or sleeping in your lap if you spend any amount of time","We both have full time jobs, but are usually home on weeknights and weekends. We are willing to interact as much as you would like at home after work, but probably have our own schedules to attend to during the week.","As mentioned, this is a quiet neighborhood with a mix of young people starting out and families, and we have neighbors living above us in the house and on either side of the house.  As such, loud, late night parties will not be hosted here.

Thank you for checking out my profile! 
I am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of ""middle aged,"" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.

If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge. 

Please contact us to confirm the exact availability of the apartment you are interested in. We’d love to host you (and your family) for your vacation or business trip.

I love the idea of B&B and now I have chance to host people from the world in my own house. Traveling is part of my life and staying with family opens chance to meet local people.
