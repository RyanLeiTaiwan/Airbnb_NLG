Thank you for checking out my profile! 
I am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of ""middle aged,"" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.
