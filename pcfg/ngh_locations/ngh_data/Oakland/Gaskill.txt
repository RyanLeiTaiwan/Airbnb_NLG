Central location with great restaurants, cafes, bars around. Right on the border of Berkeley, Emeryville and Oakland. Historic arts and crafts bungalows and victorians. Safe and diverse neighborhood.
North Oakland, and "Gaskill" in particular are an up-and-coming area, right between Temescal, Rockridge and Emeryville. It's a residential neighborhood with great people. Around the block: a gluten-free diner, a great new bar, a public library. Not far from hot restaurants in Temescal & Rockridge, and the Bay Street mall with all major shops.
The Bushrod neighborhood is diverse and thriving. Combined with the adjacent Temescal and Rockridge neighborhoods, parks, shopping, dining and recreational opportunities are close at hand.
The quiet street is off San Pablo Avenue, a lively street between Oakland and Berkeley.  Antonio's Cassave El Salvadorian Restaurant is around the corner; there are a number of neighborhood cafes within walking distance. The Pixar campus is about 8 blocks away.
We are at the nexus of North Oakland, Emeryville, and Berkeley, close to just about everything!  One mile walk to major BART stations and a short drive to San Francisco. Located in the Golden Gate neighborhood of Oakland. Most of the houses were built between 1910 and 1930 when the population of the East Bay exploded after the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.  We feel comfortable walking around during the day with our small children, and I have walked to and from public transportation at night many times without incident.  However, the neighborhood is in an urban area so it is always a good idea to be aware of one's surroundings.
