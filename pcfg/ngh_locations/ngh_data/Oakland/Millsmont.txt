A wonderful community of friendly helpful kind people..Beautiful views... very pretty
Clean, friendly neighbors, easy parking, close to freeways, great restaurants and fun neighborhoods are 10 minutes away.  There is a wonderful family style Thai Restaurant down the street.
Conveniently located close to everything.
I love the location of the house and the diversity of the neighborhood. The house is located on a very busy street and very close to the freeway. Both neighbors on either side are very friendly.  The house is very quiet inside.
I will be available to communicate with through text and phone. I will provide you with a walk through and am happy to answer any questions you may have. I will be traveling during this time but the owner of the property will be available to communicate with you if needed.
Millsmount is one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in Oakland with a good mix of long term residents and newly moved techies. Neighbors look out for each other. Shopping good just off on Fruitvale exit on 580, shopping area with Farmer Joe's, Peets, Library,  banks etc.
Quiet residential neighborhood, accessibility without the freeway noise. Grab necessities at the corner market, a block from a fantastic Thai restaurant with the best and kitchiest decor.  Go for a quick run through the Mills College campus.
The neighborhood is incredibly friendly and there are always people out walking their dogs, especially around sunset. There are also many fruiting trees that the neighbors don't mind if you pick from them!
This neighborhood is great... quiet and just a few minutes from gorgeous walks through the woods. Though residential, it does boast a few good restaurants. If you are a swimmer or runner you will be stunned by the beauty of the near by Mills College's trails and redwood laden public pool side.
