Our urban neighborhood is a 10 minute walk to Joaquin Miller Park, a 500 acre park. There is also a lovely greenfield area in our immediate neighborhood to take a lovely stroll in the evening, and enjoy the Bay city views! Often, fireworks are displayed from the Oakland Oracle Arena just down the hill below the property. Sit on your private deck, and enjoy!
