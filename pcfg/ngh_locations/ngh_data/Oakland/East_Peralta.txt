5 min walk to Lake Merritt Grocery stores (Lucky's, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods) and Farmer's Market nearby
Five minutes from downtown Oakland, historic Jack London Square and the vintage village of Alameda, this quiet location offers all the convenience of city life with a marine setting near Oakland's  waterfront district. Restaurants, shops, bars, groceries, galleries, museums, theatres, libraries, Universities, the lake, hills, trails, parks and more are just minutes away.   Keep in mind this is a public marina, not a yacht club, so salty sailors are more common than weekend warriors. I welcome guests from everywhere but this setting will likely appeal to the adventure traveler rather than those seeking room service.  Regardless of your reason for travel, enjoy a unique stay on the bay.  See my local suggestions for dining and activities, or just ask. Welcome Aboard!
Food is our neighborhood is amazing! We have a plethora of Vietnamese, Thai, Laotian, Burmese, Mexican, and Chinese food within walking distance, are about 1 mile from Chinatown and about 1 mile from Fruitvale (Mexican district). The food is cheap and delicious. We are also 1.5 miles from Grand Lake district which is a major commercial area with shops, more restaurants, a movie theater, grocery stores, etc. 
It's a great location that's close to nice restaurants, bars, grocery stores, public transportation and the very charming Lake Merritt.
The house is is Oakland's East Lake neighborhood, a diverse and accessible area just east of Lake Merritt.  There's lots of good, cheap food nearby (Vietnamese, Mexican, Thai...), and BART and downtown Oakland are easy to reach.  I've had nothing but good experiences here, but it is a working-class, urban area, which I know not everyone may be used to - just something to be aware of if you're not from the city.
