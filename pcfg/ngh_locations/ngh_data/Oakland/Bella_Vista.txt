I really like my neighborhood.  It is culturally diverse, close to public transportation and very easy to get to and from.  There are multiple buses in the area to get you wherever you to go.
Oakland is on fire these days! The Brooklyn to San Francisco's Manhattan, Oakland is the place to go if you want to experience good art, good music, good food, good cocktails, and all the thriving diversity of urban life! We love our 'hood! We're located in the historic Bella Vista neighborhood of Oakland, a truly diverse place with a lot of tall trees and old, interesting family homes. The main house is on top of a hill where you can see all the way to the Bay and out to San Francisco. We're within a mile of beautiful Lake Merritt (around which are *tons* of good bars, restaurants, and interesting shops), and within a 15-min bus ride to Downtown Oakland and an 11-min bus ride to BART (which will take you into San Francisco or Berkeley).
Our home is located on a sunny, tree-lined street. We have lovely, kind neighbors. There is an elementary school one block away with an adjacent park complete with slides, climbing structures, and skate park. Our neighborhood is near to beautiful Lake Merritt, the Saturday Grand Lake Farmers Market, shopping areas, and easy access to 100,000 acres of parkland in the Oakland Hills.
Working class neighborhood that used to be called Brooklyn, mainly made up of old victorians and old colonial style homes. Immigrants from all over the world live and own homes in the area. Not a busy neighborhood, just two busy streets and a few corner markets. Other than that, mainly full of homes and a few apartment buildings. 25 minute walk to the lake.  5 bus lines within a block to five blocks from the house.
