Close to Oracle Coliseum, bus line runs on  this street, and BART is just about a mile away. Oakland is a very large city with lots of color and diversity.  The Old downtown area has much to offer as does the Lake Merritt area and other parts as well.  We are also just a few miles from Alameda, lots of great restaurants. Very convenient to freeway, takes you easily anywhere in the Bay Area.
