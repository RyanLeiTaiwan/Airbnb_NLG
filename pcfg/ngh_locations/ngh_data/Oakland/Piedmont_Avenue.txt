It's a very central location - minutes away from Temescal, Lake Merritt, Rockridge, and Berkeley. I love living in one of the few 'destination' areas of Oakland, that also has lovely side streets for taking a stroll. I walk or run to a nearby beautiful cemetery park that is open to the public and has wonderful views of the Bay and different parts of Oakland. It's a great sunset watching spot. The Grand Lake area - including the weekend farmers market - is also within walking distance (or there's a bus) if you like to walk. 
Located 1/2 block off charming neighborhood with excellent restaurants - including one with a Michelin Star - bookstores, coffee shops, movie theatre, gym and yoga studios and wonderful shopping.  The Avenue also has a several grocery and drug stores.

Spend the day exploring, yet come back to a peaceful setting that makes you truly feel like you are on vacation.
Lovely restaurants and stores on Piedmont Avenue, just four blocks from the studio, along with places to exercise including yoga, pilates and the Barr Method as well as spas. We are also close to the Rockridge/College Avenue Business and Restaurant District.

Oakland is listed as one of the 10 most exciting cities!  Copy this link to read up: (URL HIDDEN)  San Francisco is amazing to experience, but don't let SF overshadow the beauty of Oakland.

Oakland. As some are saying the New Brooklyn. It is home to a new surge of creatives, innovators, entrepreneurs, activists, foodies, booming new businesses, and so much more. It's a stone's throw away from San Francisco, has more sunshine and overall better weather than you could find just across the bridge, with the BART transit system built to keep us connected to the parts of our city both in the East Bay and across the waters.
