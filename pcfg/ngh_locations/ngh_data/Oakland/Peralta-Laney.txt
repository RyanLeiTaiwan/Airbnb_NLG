This up-and-coming area has a gritty, urban feel, but is very quiet and safe at all hours. Less than one mile to both Lake Merritt and BART, and just two BART stops to downtown San Francisco. The immediate neighborhood boasts some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the Bay Area. The Oakland Museum of California is also within walking distance and the Uptown area, with additional restaurants and nightlife, including the Fox and Paramount Theaters, is located directly across the Lake -- a short drive or bike ride away.
