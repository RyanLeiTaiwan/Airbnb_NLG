This is a mostly residential neighborhood about one mile South East of Mills College with easy access to the freeway.   The street is a tree lined cul de sac with many families.  15 minute drive to downtown Oakland, less than 10 minutes to the Laurel and Dimond districts with cafes and great grocers like Farmer Joes.  Less than a 10 minute walk to "That Takes the Cake" coffee/cupcakery and excellent local Thai place "Old Weang Ping" (look up this little gem!)
Very friendly neighbors!  I also enjoy running in Mills College!
We love our street.  Sweet neighbors who talk to each other.  If you love connecting to diverse communities we are within walking distance of Mills College, and just down the road from Lakeshore Ave, area and the lively, downtown - uptown arts and food scene. Add to that very easy, accessible public transportation to San Francisco and beyond, make this a fantastic place to launch your weekend or work-week.
