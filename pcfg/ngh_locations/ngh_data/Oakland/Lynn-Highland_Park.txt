Fairly quiet neighborhood, there is very minor freeway noise in the distance which you may or may not notice. Nice neighbors, close to bus stop. Also, we are close to Lake Merritt which is a plus for nature lovers : )
It's a residential neighborhood.  There are 2 corner stores 150 meters away that can cover your snacks and beverage needs.  One stays open until midnight!
Mixed community - not pretentious. Great access to the Oakland hills and all the beautiful green spaces.
Oakland is a thriving, creative, bustling city. Our neighborhood is full of kind neighbors, families, couples, people walking their dogs and people sharing things. We are close to the super awesome lake merritt- a lovely watering hole where birds and people gather and walk around. We are close to Grand and Lakeshore- each with many many shops and restaurants.
One block from Highland Hospital.  Close to 580 and 880 freeways.  Bus stops on each end of the block.  Oakland Airport 15 mins away.
Sunny neighborhood and very close to Lake Merritt and Grand/Lake shopping neighborhood.
The Bella Vista neighborhood is quiet but not far from food and fun.
This apartment is directly across the street from employee parking at a hospital. So there are lots of eyes on the street. Ambulances enter on the other side of the complex, so you don't even hear them.
We feel safe here. With any city out walking around at night your awareness should be up. We've never had any problems. A few neighbors also have some pretty big German Shepherds who don't bark a lot but I know they would if they had to! We feel safe.
