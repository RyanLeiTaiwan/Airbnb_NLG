I may be biased, but I think I live in one of the funnest, most diverse, and most progressive neighborhoods in the world! There always new things happening and opening here: restaurants, bars, music venues, plays, art galleries, political movements, on and on and on. 
Lots of cool restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Close to the Paramount Theater, Fox Theater, New Parish, Cathedral of Christ the Light, Lake Merritt. Whole Foods store within walking distance.
This is literally one of the coolest neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. Oakland was recently voted one of the hippest cities in America. Come find out why! Next door to scores of bars, restaurants (every type imaginable), theaters, coffee shops, street fairs, farmer's markets, etc. The list goes on. Oaklanders love Oakland! :-)
Walking distance to the Whole Foods, Lake Merritt, Jack London Square, Kaiser, Alta Bates, the Bart(if you need to commute), nice restaurants, bars, & lounges.
We live in West Oakland. It's gritty and we love it. It's loud and active - it's the city.
