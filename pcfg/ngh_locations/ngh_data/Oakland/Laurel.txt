Allendale is the neighborhood PLEASE READ: 'Location' is the only thing that Airbnb has informed us we could improve. However, we aren't going to move our house to another location! The neighborhood is not dangerous, but it is not upscale. That is the reason the price is LOW compared to whatever else you can find for a private bedroom in a clean, quiet, and loving home. If you want a bedroom that meets our high standards AND is in a very nice neighborhood AND is super convenient, be prepared to spend more $$$
