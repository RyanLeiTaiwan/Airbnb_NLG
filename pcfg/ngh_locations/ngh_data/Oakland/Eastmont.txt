East Oakland
If you're coming into the Oakland Airport, we can try to arrange to pick you up. We have an electric SMART car available for rent through Turo (URL HIDDEN) and if you rent that car while you stay, you can recharge it for free in our garage. People familiar with Oakland, know that there is crime almost everywhere. There is not crime on our block and hasn't been for over three years. However, the same can not be said for the streets that run perpendicular to our block. Which means that although this is pedestrian friendly neighborhood, and public transit is readily available, we recommend that visitors drive or use taxis/uber, etc. This is not unique to our house, it's just the nature of The Bay Area.
It's quiet and located in a central location convinent to everywhere in the Bay Area.
This neighborhood is mixed between sketchy and peaceful--the street I live on is peaceful, but some of the surrounding blocks have crime.
