The home is located in a residential neighborhood comprised of single-family homes and small multi-family residences, and street parking is abundant.  There isn't any coffee shops or anything in walking distance, but Mills College is 1 mile from the house and it is 1.5 mile to the Fruitvale BART station (accessible via bus during commuter hours Mon-Fri).  The closest destination for restaurants and shops is the Laurel District, which is accessible via car, there are of course many other nearby areas such as Lake Merritt/Grand Avenue, Alameda, Berkeley, Emeryville for shopping and dining that are accessible by car or a very determined bus rider.
The neighborhood affords walks that showcase pretty houses, gardens, and hills for viewing the west bay.   While many neighbors have lived here for decades, the yet-to-be gentrified business "district" is recovering from 2008 and currently limited in variety.   But there is a coffee shop two short blocks away, an African restaurant, a Carnegie library, and multiple convenience stores nearby.  There may be more on offer in the future.  We are also about 12 minutes drive from the Joaquin Miller park along Skyline Blvd.
i'm on a quiet street, only one block long, in a socio-economically diverse neighborhood. i feel safe here but i do make sure my house and car are locked up. it's a residential neighborhood with no destinations in walking distance.
