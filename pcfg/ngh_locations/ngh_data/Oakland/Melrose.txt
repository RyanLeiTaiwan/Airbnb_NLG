East-Oakland is still a very industrial area - but our complex is completely gated off and very safe. There are a great deal of authentic Mexican restaurants within walking distance (under 5 minutes) away. The Oakland airport is a 10 minute drive, The Oakland Coliseum is less than 10 minutes away.
This neighborhood is working-class, ethnically diverse, and offers the most authentic, tasty Mexican food in all of the Bay! It's close to Fruitvale BART and various bus lines on International Blvd.
