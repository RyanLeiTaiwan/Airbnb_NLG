Having lived in NYC for over a decade before moving to Oakland in 2014 we still marvel at how conveniently located the house is - we're literally minutes to all the surrounding areas (Berkeley, San Fran, Walnut Creek, etc) and just as close to hiking trails and beautiful scenic drives.  
It's best feature is that it is within a 10-minute walk of the Rockridge BART, casual restaurants, upscale restaurants, cafes, bars, grocery stores, yoga, gym, shopping, ice cream shops, a farmer's market and more.   From the Rockridge BART stop, downtown San Francisco is just 20 minutes away. (Getting to downtown S.F. can be quicker from Rockridge than from many parts of San Francisco).  The city was rated by Rand McNally as having some of the best weather in the country.  Forbes Magazine listed Oakland's Uptown district as one of the top ten hipster neighborhoods in America, the New York Times placed Oakland on the paper's Top Ten list of cities in the world to visit, and journals ranging from the Wall Street Journal to the UK Guardian have all ran features extolling Oakland's innovative culinary scene. Quick drive or BART ride to children's activities, the stadiums for the Oakland A's, Oakland Raiders, Golden State Warriors and S.F. Giants and quick access to all that San Francisco

And that same 10 minute walk gets you to BART (the subway) for quick access to SF, Berkeley, downtown Oakland, A's, Raiders, and Giants games - all without a car (sorry if you're a 49'ers fans, they moved themselves to the suburbs when they moved to Santa Clara).

We have lived here for over 30 years and love our neighborhood. The neighbors are friendly and most nights there is a beautiful sunset. It is within walking distance of Lake Temescal Park with large grassy areas for picnics and of course the lake for swimming, hiking, walking, running.
We love the gorgeous Art Deco/Mediterranean vibe of the homes, the long winding roads, the secret stair walks,and the peace and quiet, even though we are walking distance from the bustling College Ave. 
We've lived on our street for 25 years. Lovely outlook from our charming studio - palm trees, a beautiful little park across the street.. An easy walk to College Ave shops, award winning restaurants, cafes and the Rockridge BART station. Easy to stay without a car. Our own little piece of heaven!
