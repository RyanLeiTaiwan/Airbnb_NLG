Per Kono's Central Business District website: "KONO is the neighborhood that defines the new Oakland. This up and coming community has become the 'unofficial' hub of arts and culture in the Bay Area, featuring the Oakland First Fridays Festival and Art Murmur Gallery Walk, which draws over twenty thousand attendees each month . . . Along and with the arts, KONO features Oakland's most popular craft beer gardens and pubs. Visit KONO to see what all the Oakland hype is about." This area is fantastic. For one thing, we're near a bunch of transit stops. You can get anywhere throughout the Bay from here. Secondly, a dense amount of bars, restaurants, cafes, theaters, and places for general activities are opening along Telegraph and Broadway from 14th Street to North Oakland, and Kono's at the heart of that action.  KONO is in the perfect center of all the action. You'll be making a great choice.
Unban, trendy, lots of restaurants and coffee shops,  close to Bart and Bus stop. We have loved living here for 19 years.
