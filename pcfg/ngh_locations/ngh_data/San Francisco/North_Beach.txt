Most desirable neighborhood in San Francisco.  North Beach.  Known as the Italian district, it boasts incredible food, great views, and lots of shops and boutiques to explore.
My sister and I've lived in North Beach for three years and it's seriously the best neighborhood. Wanna do touristy things? Cable car stop is LITERALLY a block away, twisty Lombard Street is 7 minutes away--and that's including the time it takes you to get a cuppa coffee at one of our many, many coffee shops. Cheapo dive bars (check out La Roccas and International) sit side by side with really great restaurants guaranteed to satisfy all budgets and palates. You're a hop, skip and a weeeee little hill (come on it's SF) away from Grant St, a hidden gem with some seriously great shopping. Wanna experience real tech-bro culture? Off to the Marina with you (15 min walk). Then unwind with the hippies at Washington Square park--sooo much better than overrated Dolores Park (hippies>hipsters).  These are just the things I love to do, but there's so much more.  But honestly, I have to say this neighborhood, for being a major tourist attraction, is also incredibly homey. People here are, gasp, ni

North Beach is where Italian immigrants first settled upon migrating westward from Europe and the East Coast, both before and during the Gold Rush of the mid-1800s and in the early part of the 19th and 20th centuries. Much of North Beach has retained the old-world feel of the late 1800s and early 1900s, and you'll still hear Italian being spoken on the streets and in the many cafes that dot the area. Some of the best food in the city, Italian or otherwise, can be found in North Beach. With Chinatown right next door, you've got two continents easily represented for culinary delights. The city has dutifully limited the amount of chain establishments that can take residence in North Beach, so you're sure to sample only genuine fare while here.

North Beach neighborhood, close to Coit Tower and walking distance to everything.
North Beach sits on Telegraph Hill, the historic site of a semaphore tower used to alert San Francisco residents to the arrival of ships passing through the Golden Gate Straits and into San Francisco Bay. Originally the area of the city where San Francisco’s Irish populate settled, Telegraph Hill’s western slope slowly merged with North Beach where the first Italian immigrants to San Francisco and to California put down roots. Much of Telegraph Hill and North Beach retain an old-world feel of the late 1800s and early 1900s and can be seen in the many historic buildings. North Beach has also maintained the 1920’s Bohemian influence of New York transplants or admirers, hoping to turn North Beach into a San Francisco or West Coast version of New York’s West Village. Some of the best food in the city, Italian or otherwise, can be found in Telegraph Hill, North Beach, and the surrounds. The city has dutifully limited the amount of chain establishments that can take residence in the area, so
North Beach was ranked as one of America’s Top 10 Great Neighborhoods by the American Planning Association in 2007.

Most people who come to visit San Francisco consider our neighborhood a highlight because of its history and authentic character. The main reasons we consider North Beach our favourite neighborhood are the small family-run Italian restaurants, the unique and opinionated locals who are never shy to tell you what is on their minds, the variety of cozy cafes, the fresh produce we can buy at Chinatown, and its central location. We are walking distance to so many wonderful sites. In fact, we rarely drive. We can walk to a movie theater in about 10 minutes. Downtown, Russian Hill, Fisher
