It is in the center of everything you could possibly want access to. 2 minute walk to South Station - the main bus/train terminal, and where the airport shuttle is. 2 minute walk to Chinatown. 5 minute walk to Downtown Crossing - shopping, theater, restaurants. 8 minute walk to the harbor - beautiful view and nice restaurants. 10 minute walk to Boston Common - my favourite place of the city. 15 minute walk to Boston Public Market/Heymarket. 20 minute walk to TD Garden. Extremely close to the red line (South Station), which takes you straight to MIT and/or Harvard, the orange line (Downtown Crossing), which goes to Back Bay and North Eastern, the green line (Park Station or Boylston Station) that takes you to Copley Square, Prudential Center etc..
The Neighborhood is Boston Financial District.  What makes this location unique is how close the South Station Red line is to this apartment.  Also, you are just walking distance to Boston Commons, Faneuil Hall, Govenment Center, North End, Seaport District, and Back Bay.  With the local metro train downstairs, you can get to anyplace in Boston in 20 min.
