Green space lovers will love the neighborhood! Lots of trees, wildlife, and hiking trails within minutes of the property. Perfect for folks who prefer low key to convenient and don't mind being on the outskirts of town. Closest BART stations are Fruitivale and MacArthur, both 12 min away. Guests without vehicles may feel isolated.  Shopping and eclectic eateries are nearby, with easy freeway access to highways 580 and 13, making travel to SF and other locals convenient and fast. Walking the neighborhood during the day is an enjoyable way to get some exercise and fresh air, and we feel lucky that are neighbors are close by but mostly out of sight.
This location is a rural hideout, but we are close to two freeways for easy access to many hip neighborhoods with restaurants and shops in just a 5-10 minute drive. Also great for cycling.
