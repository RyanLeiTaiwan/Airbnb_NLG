Downtown Oakland/Civic Center. 5 minute walk to the popular and hip Uptown neighborhood with nightlife, galleries, dining, and shopping. 10 minute walk to Jack London Square area. 15-20min to downtown San Francisco via BART.
Neighborhood is close to the heart of downtown. There's lots of bars, good restaurants, and shops nearby. The building is 2 1/2 blocks from Lake Merritt and directly across from the library. The Saturday morning Farmer's Market is about a 20 minute walk across the lake and Jack London Square and waterfront is about a 15 minute walk away.
Oakland is changing, with over 200 new restaurants opened just this past year.  Uptown Oakland has exquisite clubs and restaurants, and Art Murmur, the first Fridays of the month, should not be missed!
The Lake! Great for a morning walk or jog or a lazy picnic.  Oakland is definitely the sunny side of the bay.  Always warm and sunny with little to no wind compared to SF.
`Close to Lake, downtown, Chinatown, Jack London Square, restaurants, bars and public transportation.
