It's very quiet and in the hills.
Montclair is a friendly, beautiful neighborhood. I love that we live on a level street, in the lower area of the hills. It's conveniently close to "The Village," No long, winding roads to get lost in; easy access to other cities.
Our street is super freindly, lots of kids and dogs , a 35 min loop walk will take you up to great sweeping views of the bay .Little montclair is 5 min. by car or 25 to walk ( less if you're in good shape) has a few great restaurants and most things you need and , count em - 4 coffee / tea shops .   Sunday we have a super farmers market
The neighborhood is quiet, up in the hills but only a short drive away from Rockridge Bart and the amenities of Montclair Village and Rockridge.
This neighborhood is a little piece of heaven secluded from the hustle and bustle of Oakland. It has trees, parks, hiking trails, and a small village with shops and restaurants close by.
