I love this neighborhood. It is simple, has the necessities, and is super peaceful. My favorite part is that we are 5 minutes from endless hiking trails that you can get lost in.
Oakland is an amazing city. Our neighborhood is a gem. The view is stunning up here, it's quiet, the air is clear and the weather is good almost everyday.  Just up the hill are some amazing parks and trails with very tall redwood trees. Check out Redwood Regional Park and Joaquin Miller Park. Berkeley is 20 minutes north by car, Lake Merritt and Downtown Oakland are 15 minutes away, Oakland Airport is about 20 minutes away. San Francisco is about 25 minutes away across the Bay Bridge when traffic is light. (But there's usually traffic to SF.) Just 5 minutes away at Fruitvale Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard you will find grocery stores, such as Farmer Joe's and Safeway, a gas station, pastry shop, restaurants, pharmacy, library and more!
We are in the Laurel/Dimond district of Oakland, and quaint shopping, great restaurants and typical needs are available only blocks away. We have a walk safe score of 82, and evening walks in the neighborhood are punctuated by the scents of Jasmine, Orange blossoms and Lilac. Walking up the hill you will have a beautiful view of the Bay Area, Twin Peaks, the Bay bridge and Golden Gate bridge. Neighbors are friendly and approachable.
We live in the Lincoln Highlands neighborhood which offers: * Wonderful neighborhood walks right outside your door * Many great hiking trails just minutes from home * Easy access to Mills College * Two outdoor pools and two sets of tennis courts are nearby and are open to the public year-round * We're 1/2 mile from the Dimond shopping district offering banks, grocery stores, a library, restaurants, a bakery, and bars.
