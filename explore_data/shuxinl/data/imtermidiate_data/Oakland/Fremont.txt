Nice, safe clean & quiet.
The neighborhood is diverse and eclectic. This is a lower-income, working class area - so expect extremely inexpensive mexican dining and taco trucks. The nearest Supermarket is only a few blocks away. The nearest Cafes are near the BART station (15 minute walk). Two Mamas Cafe is all-vegan and serves Sunday Brunch.
We are in Jefferson, which was just named #1 in Zillow's "Hottest San Francisco Metro Neighborhoods for 2016."   It's a lovely, quiet area of Oakland, at the edge of Fruitvale and Maxwell Park neighborhoods.  Cool local culture is within walking distance.  Hill-top views of Oakland, including full views of stadium fireworks after Raiders games.  It's not exactly a "bougie neighborhood," meaning there isn't a high end coffee shop around the corner, but it's very convenient to wonderful Fruitvale, Laurel, and Alameda shopping districts, BART, and both major highways, plus tons of local joys.
We are very close to the Fruitvale shopping area, Mills college, and the Coliseum. We are at the border of the upscale Maxwell Park neighborhood which makes for a great walk.
