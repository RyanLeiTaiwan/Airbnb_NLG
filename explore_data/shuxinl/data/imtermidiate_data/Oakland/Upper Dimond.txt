Multicultural residential neighborhood is quiet, safe and sweet. Neighbors know each other and many have lived on our one-block long street for years.  House is ten-minute drive to both the Bay Bridge (20 mins to downtown SF with no traffic) and to the Redwoods and hiking trails of the Oakland hills. Public pool, park and shopping district with cafes and natural foods market are just 5 minutes down the hill.
My neighborhood is full of friendly families and pets.  It is a short walk from many, interesting, locally-owned businesses.  We get the warmth and sunshine of Oakland with close proximity to San Francisco.
Oakland is a city of neighborhoods, and Dimond is one of the smaller ones. The condo is just a few blocks from a great coffee shop (Hive, the Place to Bee) and market (Farmer Joe's), as well as a few other stores. You can walk through Dimond Park to Park Ave, where you will find a number of good restaurants (we love Bellanico for dinner). Or head down MacArthur Blvd. to the Laurel, an up and coming neighborhood we visit often for breakfast (Sequoia Diner is delicious!). Lake Merritt is a 7 minute drive or a 40 minute walk, and they have plenty of fun spots for dining, drinking, shopping, or just taking a walk. Ordinaire is our favorite wine bar, and the farmer's market by the lake on Saturday is great!
