My home is located in the Dimond District of Oakland, and it's a wonderfully diverse neighborhood. There is a great grocery store close by, about an 8 minute walk from my apartment as well as Peet's Coffee and a charming French Bakery called La Farine. There is a sushi restaurant, taco trucks, soul food and different cafes all within a half mile.  Walking at night is not recommended but I personally don't mind walking in the day time by myself.  There are great hikes a short drive away up in the hills where you can take a great hike in the Redwoods in Joaquin Miller Park.
The Dimond neighborhood is a beautiful residential neighborhood with cafes, restaurants, bars, shops, a library, post office, yoga and pilates studios, and two lovely parks. It is easy driving or public transportation distance from downtown Oakland and the parks of the Oakland Hills.
We are very close to the Dimond District. Our hood is made up of working families and is more safe and clean than Fruitvale central. Multiple ethnicities, cultures and sexual orientations all within one block in any direction. We live on a cul-de-sac so that also isolates us from "passers thru". Farmer Joes is a big local grocer with tons of fresh produce and health store type food including a bulk section. Health food grocer Food Mill will have many plant-based (allowed in house) foods. Also Safeway and Peets coffee. Pizza, Indian and Chinese restaurants are all within walking distance.
