We live in East Oakland. We are an easy drive away from restaurants and shops in Alameda, Downtown Oakland, San Francisco, San Leandro, & Berkeley. There is not much to walk to in our immediate vicinity, besides the Oracle Arena home of the Warriors & Oakland Coliseum home of the A's & Raiders. Our street is quiet and calm. All of the neighbors on our street are very nice and parking is not an issue.
