I love the diversity of my neighborhood and the friendliness of my neighbors who come from Laos and El Salvador.  There is a conveniently located and inexpensive grocery store less than 4 blocks from my house. There's also a delicious taco truck only 3 blocks from my house.
I love the diversity of this sometimes noisy  neighborhood and the neighbors are very friendly.
We are in Jefferson, which was just named #1 in Zillow's "Hottest San Francisco Metro Neighborhoods for 2016."   It's a lovely, quiet area of Oakland, at the edge of charming Fruitvale and Maxwell Park neighborhoods.  Cool local culture is within walking distance.  Hill-top views of Oakland, including full views of stadium fireworks after Raiders games.  It's not exactly a "bougie neighborhood," meaning there isn't a high end coffee shop around the corner, but it's very convenient to wonderful Fruitvale, Laurel, and Alameda shopping districts, BART, and both major highways, plus tons of local joys.
