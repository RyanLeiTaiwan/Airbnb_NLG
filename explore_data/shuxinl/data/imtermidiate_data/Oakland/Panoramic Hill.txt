Our home is located near the edge of campus land overlooking a wooded canyon up a 'no outlet' road. It is a quiet old historic neighborhood with lots of artsy character.  The best thing about our neighborhood is the feeling that one is out in nature, but conveniently being within a quick walking distance to downtown berkeley and campus. Most of the traffic consists of people hiking up to the nature areas (we are about half way up). It is a short but steep walk into this historic neighborhood. Some people find it challenging but many come to love the walk and the reward of a retreat after the business of the city and campus.
Panoramic Hill has a stunning view of the Bay and many running trails
Quite settings nestled among trees overlooking the bay area. If you are in the mood for shopping and dinning - check out College & Ashby, College & Claremont, Shattuck - north of University Ave. and Market Hall across from Rockridge Bart station as well as The Claremont Hotel & Spa. (Sunday brunch at Claremot has live piano and a nice view) 
We are about a mile up into the Hills so very peaceful and green...yet 5 minute drive to College Ave shops and restaurants, UC Berkeley, and Montclair. 15 minute drive to SF or  Uber can take you to Rockridge Bart and you are off to SF.
