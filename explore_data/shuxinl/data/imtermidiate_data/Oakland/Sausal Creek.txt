Oakland is an amazing place to live.  The Dimond district is just one of those tucked away neighborhoods that has everything, especially a feeling of community. With in walking distance there are hiking trails, delicious and affordable restaurants, grocery stores, banks, bars, a library, post office, and  multiple public parks including one with a pool and tennis courts. In the fall the local businesses organize an Octoberfest street fair and host a community Thanksgiving.
The apartment is located in Fruitvale, Oakland, a vibrant and diverse working-class, predominantly Latino community filled with artists, writers, and long-time residents from all over the world. Don't expect glitz and glam, as this is a neighborhood in transition, but what it lacks in boutique hotels and over-priced restaurants, it makes up in heart and friendly neighbors. Our biggest recommendation to guests: talk to folks you see on the street. Folks here are willing to help give you directions, recommend eateries, or tell you tips about transit, but you can always ask us about that, too, of course!  Fruitvale district also has an amazing history, serving as the epicenter for the Chicano Movement in the 1960s and 1970s.
