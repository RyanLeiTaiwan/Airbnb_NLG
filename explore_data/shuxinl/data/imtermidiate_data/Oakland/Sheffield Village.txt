Our neighborhood, Sheffield Village, is right off the 580 freeway, yet quiet and peaceful with its own neighborhood park, tennis court, and hiking trails in the hills behind the Village.  Cafes, restaurants, convenience store, and the #75 bus at the gas station are within walking distance.
This part of the Oakland Hills is quiet, wild and little known. Go right from the house to access great hiking trails. If you're lucky, you even might catch a glimpse of our resident Bald Eagles. We are close to some great restaurants in San Leandro - and of course, the rest of the foodie mecca Oakland has become. The Oakland Zoo, the Lake Chabot Golf Course, and the historic Dunsmuir Mansion are all within a couple miles. The Chabot Space and Science Center is 6 miles away and the Oakland airport is 4 miles away! Without traffic, San Francisco is  an easy 20 min. drive.
