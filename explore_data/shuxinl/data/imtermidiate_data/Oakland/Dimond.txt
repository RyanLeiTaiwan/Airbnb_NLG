Great walking neighborhood, home to numerous restaurants, grocery store, commuter & transportation dream. Scenic, lovely neighborhood with nice trees and views.
I love Everything! Oakland is a great city with so much to do! Always perfect weather, Mediterranean climate! Everything from farmers market to great dining, great outdoor places, newly renovated Jack London square with hip restaurants, PLANK  Beer garden, bocce ball, bowling, beautiful Lake Merrit, movie theatres, live shows, great restaurants! We are near Montclair and Lake Merritt (Saturday Farmers Market!) Our neighborhood is a great walking neighborhood, beautiful parks, tennis court, public pool, ice cream shops, breakfast cafes, bakeries, Laundromat, Indian food, Japenese Restaurant, you name it: this community has it !! We are a 5 min. walk to area buses, a 10 min walk to the carpool to S.F., a 15 min. bike ride to BART, a 15 min. drive (no traffic) to San Francisco, and 15 min. to UC Berkeley. Parking is free and easily available on the street. We can also help you with directions to wherever you might want to go.
We live in a diverse urban area in Oakland with quick access to the 580 interstate heading into San Francisco and all points around the Bay. In addition to being blocks away from health food and grocery stores, a yoga studio, restaurants, and a few cafes, there are banks, ATMs, a U.S. Post Office, and a branch of the Oakland Public Library in the neighborhood also just a few blocks away. There is also a year-round heated lap swimming pool about half a mile away.
